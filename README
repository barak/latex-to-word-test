For when evil is needed: a snippet to remember how to convert latex to
Microsoft Word format.  Best so far is the oolatex command in the
tex4ht package, which produces an ODT file that can be loaded into
ooffice, which can write in various common document formats.  I've
heard there is also a module to load ODT directly into Microsoft Word.
